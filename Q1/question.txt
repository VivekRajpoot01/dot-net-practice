Practice Question 1: Inheritance and Price Calculation
Topic: Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Methods) Source Context: This is a classic "M1" style question found in your curriculum materials.
Scenario
You are building an application for "Bejoy Computers" to calculate the price of a machine based on its configuration. You need to handle data for a base Computer and a specific Desktop.
Requirements
1. Class Computer Create a class named Computer with the following public properties:
• Processor (string)
• RamSize (int)
• HardDiskSize (int)
• GraphicCard (int)
2. Class Desktop Create a class named Desktop that inherits from Computer.
• Add public properties: MonitorSize (int), PowerSupplyVolt (int).
• Implement a method: public double DesktopPriceCalculation().
3. Calculation Logic Inside DesktopPriceCalculation, return the total price based on this formula: 
Price=ProcessorCost+(RamSize×200)+(HardDiskSize×1500)+(GraphicCard×2500)+(MonitorSize×250)+(PowerSupplyVolt×20)
Processor Costs (Case-sensitive):
• "i3": 1500
• "i5": 3000
• "i7": 4500
• Any other processor: 0 cost (or handle as standard)
4. Class Program (Main Method) In the Main method, you must:
1. Read the inputs in the exact order shown in the Sample Input.
2. Create an object of the Desktop class.
3. Assign the values to the object.
4. Call DesktopPriceCalculation().
5. Print the result strictly as: "Desktop price is [Result]"
Sample Input/Output
Input:
Enter the processor
i3
Enter the ram size
8
Enter the hard disk size
32
Enter the graphic card size
32
Enter the monitor size
22
Enter the power supply volt
240
Output:
Desktop price is 141400
⚠️ Critical Exam Rules
1. Do not use Environment.Exit() to terminate the program.
2. Keep all classes, properties, and methods public.
3. Output text must match exactly (case-sensitive).
