📝 Scenario: Movie Ticket Booking
Sam and his friends are planning to watch a movie. The theater offers different seating types (VIP, Premium, Standard). You need to create an application to calculate the total ticket fare using a Static Class to hold the movie details.
⚙️ Requirements
1. Static Class Movie
• Properties (Public Static):
    ◦ MovieName (string)
    ◦ ScreenNumber (string)
    ◦ TicketPrice (double)
    ◦ NoOfTickets (int)
2. Class MovieUtility
• Method:
    ◦ public double CalculateTicketFare(string seatingType)
    ◦ Logic:
        1. Base Cost: TicketPrice * NoOfTickets
        2. Additional Fee: 2 per ticket (i.e., 2 * NoOfTickets)
        3. Surcharge:
            • VIP: 50% of the total ticket cost.
            • Premium: 30% of the total ticket cost.
            • Standard: No surcharge.
        4. Formula: Base Cost + Additional Fee + Surcharge
    ◦ Note: seatingType is Case-Sensitive.
3. Class Program (Main Method)
• Logic:
    1. Get inputs: Movie Name, Screen Number, No of Tickets, Ticket Price, Seating Type.
    2. Important: Assign these values directly to the Static Properties of the Movie class (e.g., Movie.MovieName = ...).
    3. Create an instance of MovieUtility (this class is not static).
    4. Call CalculateTicketFare.
    5. Output: "The ticket price is [Result]"
