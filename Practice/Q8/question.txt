Question 8: Regex & Collections
Topic: List<T> Management with Validation Source Scenario: Modified from "Confidential Case Files"
Scenario: Sam is working with confidential case files. He needs a system to add cases to a centralized list only if the Case Code is valid. He also needs to delete cases by ID.
Requirements:
1. Class Case:
    ◦ Properties: CaseNo (int), CaseCode (string), CaseContent (string), Date (DateTime).
2. Class Program:
    ◦ Static List: public static List<Case> CaseFile = new List<Case>();
    ◦ Method AddToList(Case caseObj):
        ▪ Regex Validation: The CaseCode must start with "KN" followed strictly by 3 digits (e.g., "KN240").
        ▪ Use System.Text.RegularExpressions.
        ▪ If Valid: Add to CaseFile and return true.
        ▪ If Invalid: Do not add, return false.
    ◦ Method DeleteFromList(int caseNo):
        ▪ Remove the case with the matching CaseNo. Return true if found/removed, else false.
Sample Input (Add):

150
KN240

Sample Output:
Added successfully
(If CaseCode was "AB123", output should be "Adding failed")
