Question: Word Frequency Counter (Ignoring Case and Punctuation)

Problem Statement:

You are required to write a program that counts the frequency of each word in a given paragraph.

The program must follow these rules:

The comparison should be case-insensitive (e.g., "Hello" and "hello" should be treated as the same word).

All punctuation marks such as . , ! ? ; : ' " ( ) must be ignored.

Words should be separated based on whitespace.

The output should display each word along with its frequency.

The words in the output should be displayed in alphabetical order.

Input Format:

A single line of text (string) containing words and punctuation.

Output Format:

Each line should display a word followed by its frequency in the format:

word : frequency

Sample Input:
Hello world! Hello, OpenAI. This is a test. Hello world?

Sample Output:
a : 1
hello : 3
is : 1
openai : 1
test : 1
this : 1
world : 2

Explanation:

The word "Hello" appears three times (ignoring case and punctuation).

The word "world" appears twice.

All punctuation marks are removed before processing.

Output is sorted alphabetically.
